# Udacity-Documentation-Group-Project
For participants in the Grow with Google Scholarship: Front-End Web Dev program to practice their coding sills and wrap their heads around Javascript. 
<h2> Motivation </h2>
The best way to learn is to be forced to teach others, so this project aims at giving newbies an opportunity to code, collaborate via Git, and teach others parts of Javascript. 
<h3> Getting Started</h3>
Create a fork of the current repository to get started on the project. Then, be sure to create a branch of the master for making additions to the index.html on that branch. 

<h4> Individual Contribution</h4>
<ul>
<li>1- On index.html, be sure to add your topic in the navigation bar, following alphabetic order.</li>
  <li>2- Be sure to use commit messages to show the changes you make to your branched version of index.html.</li>
<li>3- Working off of the template-page, write the code for your page.</li>
<li>4- Retitle this new page following the pattern of topic-name-page (ie. "foreach-page.html", or "for-loop-page.html").</li> 
<li>5- Make a Pull Request to initiate discussion about your commits. </li>
<li> 6- Wait for comments from the team reviewing the submissions to ensure the style pages are consistent.</li>
</ul>

<h5> Directory Structure</h5>
Each "page" should go in the Topics folder. When writing your code, be sure to use relative links.
