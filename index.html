      					<p>This site revolves around the learner. We wanted to give people a documentation page that taught concepts with a less technical approach. When someone first jumps into programming, documentation can be an intimidating body of writing. And yet, at times it is their only source of help. So, in order to assist the beginnger, we've endeavored to provide help by breaking down the concepts into simpler terms with illustrative explanations. We hope you find the documentation contained within this site useful for your education of all things Javascript.</p>

      					<p>As stated, this site revolves around the learner. The pages you'll see were written by individuals new to programming. Most have the Grow with Google Scholarship: Front End Web Dev program through Udacity to thank for their burgeoning coding knowledge. For those individuals, this site was invented to give them additional coding experience, an opportunity to explain a Javascript concept, and an avenue to participate in a collaborative endeavor. At the bottom of each topic you will find a brief biography of the individual who wrote it. Thank you for stopping by, and thank you to all who helped build this.</p>
